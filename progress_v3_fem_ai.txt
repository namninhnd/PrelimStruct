### Feature 11 Code Review
Review Date: 2026-01-22
Reviewer: Code Reviewer Agent (Opus)

#### Summary: APPROVED with recommendations

#### Files Reviewed
- `src/ai/__init__.py` (new)
- `src/ai/providers.py` (new)
- `src/ai/config.py` (new)
- `src/ai/prompts.py` (new)
- `src/ai/llm_service.py` (new)
- `src/ai/response_parser.py` (new)
- `tests/test_ai_providers.py` (new)
- `.env.example` (new)

#### Test Results
- 68 unit tests executed, **all passing** (100% pass rate)
- Syntax check: PASSED for all modules
- Import verification: PASSED

#### Issues Found

**MAJOR (should fix)**
1. `src/ai/__init__.py` - Missing AIService export
   - The `AIService` class is not exported in `__init__.py`
   - Breaks documented usage: `from src.ai import AIService`
   - Recommended fix: Add `from .llm_service import AIService` and include in `__all__`

2. Missing unit tests for supporting modules:
   - `src/ai/config.py` - No dedicated tests (AIConfig class)
   - `src/ai/prompts.py` - No dedicated tests
   - `src/ai/response_parser.py` - No dedicated tests
   - `src/ai/llm_service.py` - No dedicated tests (AIService class)
   - Recommended: Add tests for these modules (Task 15.4 can cover this)

**MINOR (nice to fix)**
1. `src/ai/providers.py:1598-1662` - `_StubProvider` class still present but unused
   - Can be removed to clean up code

#### Positive Notes
- ✅ Excellent provider implementation with factory pattern
- ✅ All 68 provider tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Type hints on all function signatures
- ✅ Detailed Google-style docstrings
- ✅ HK Code 2013 references in system prompts
- ✅ Proper API key security:
  - Keys loaded from environment variables
  - `mask_api_key()` method for safe logging
  - `.env` properly in `.gitignore`
  - `.env.example` with placeholder values
- ✅ Well-defined error hierarchy
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff + jitter
- ✅ JSON mode support for structured outputs
- ✅ Modular design with clear separation of concerns

#### Recommended Actions
1. Add AIService to `src/ai/__init__.py` exports (MAJOR)
2. Add unit tests for config, prompts, response_parser, llm_service modules
3. Remove unused `_StubProvider` class (cleanup)

#### Handoff
- **Next Phase**: Feature 12 (AI-Assisted Mesh Generation)
- **Dependencies Met**: Feature 11 provides provider infrastructure for Features 12-14
- **Open Issues**: AIService export fix needed before UI integration
