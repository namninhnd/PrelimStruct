# Handoff 2026-02-07 04:05 (Playwright open issue)

Project: C:\Users\daokh\Desktop\PrelimStruct v3-5

Open issue
- Playwright analysis step still timing out waiting for "Analysis Successful" for base case (3x2 bays, 8 floors). Script now times out after 180s if banner not shown.
- 3D View button can remain disabled when analysis does not complete; test aborts with explicit error.

What changed
- Updated Playwright script to use a smaller base case and optional tall-building analysis.
- Added analysis completion wait helper and gating logic for Run FEM Analysis button.

Manual test suggestion
- Run Streamlit (`streamlit run app.py --server.headless true`) and trigger analysis manually to verify completion banner and 3D View behavior.
